# PLSA

A Python Library of Statistical Analyze for using in my private workflow.

# Introduction

This project is a Python Library of Statistical Analyze(PLSA). In order to not coding easily, I packed all files to a package for reusing. Further more, this package will mainly use for statistical analyze in medical data.

This package will be updated anytime.

Tools in the package is listed below:

1. data
    1.1 processing: process data.
2. surv
    2.1 cutoff: get optimal cutoffs according different criterion in survival analyze.
    2.2 utils: general function in survival data.
3. utils
    3.1 cutoff: get optimal cutoffs according different criterion in common.
    3.2 metrics: evaluate models by some metrics.
    3.3 test: hypothetical test.
    3.4 write: save sklearn model.
4. vision
    4.1 calibration: plot calibration curve.
    4.2 roc: plot ROC curve.
    4.3 survrisk: plot survial function of groups.
