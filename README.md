A Python Library of Statistical Analyze for using in my private workflow.

# Introduction

This project is a Python Library of Statistical Analyze(PLSA). For working easily, I packed all files to a package for reusing. Have to mention that this package will mainly use for statistical analyze in medical data.

This package will be updated anytime.

Tools in the package is listed below respectively:

- data
    - processing: process data.
- qcal
    - func: call general function quickly.
- surv
    - cutoff: get optimal cutoffs according different criterion in survival analyze.
    - utils: include general function in survival analyze.
- utils
    - cutoff: get optimal cutoffs according different criterion in common use.
    - metrics: evaluate models by some metrics.
    - test: include hypothetical test.
    - write: save and output sklearn model.
- vision
    - calibration: plot calibration curve.
    - roc: plot ROC curve.
    - survrisk: plot survial function of different risk-groups.
    - lib: include general function in plotting figure.
