# PLSA

A Python Library of Statistical Analyze for using in my private workflow.

# Introduction

This project is a Python Library of Statistical Analyze(PLSA). In order to not coding easily, I packed all files to a package for reusing. Further more, this package will mainly use for statistical analyze in medical data.

This package will be updated anytime.

Tools in the package is listed below:

- data
    - processing: process data.
- surv
    - cutoff: get optimal cutoffs according different criterion in survival analyze.
    - utils: general function in survival data.
- utils
    - cutoff: get optimal cutoffs according different criterion in common.
    - metrics: evaluate models by some metrics.
    - test: hypothetical test.
    - write: save sklearn model.
- vision
    - calibration: plot calibration curve.
    - roc: plot ROC curve.
    - survrisk: plot survial function of groups.

# TODO list

- Complete integration.
- Enable package setup.
- Test package.
